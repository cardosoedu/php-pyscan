# php-pyscan
A simple Python program that searches for suspicious PHP code based on regex patterns.

The Python script contains some grep commands that I made based on multiple malicious PHP programs and executes these commands inside a given directory, using the subprocess module.

Ideally, the script should not use any local commands and my intent is to - as I progress in my learning - build up a more advanced scanner that doesn't rely on grep or any other commands.

Any feedback is appreciated.
