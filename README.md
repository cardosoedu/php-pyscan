# php-pyscan
A simple Python program that searches for suspicious PHP code based on regex patterns.

Right now, the idea is that the file searches recursively for php files and then returns files that match specific patterns. These patterns are created based on multiple PHP malware or infected files.

Any feedback is appreciated.
